###  Mail Integration for Office 365/Outlook (using OAuth2 and Microsoft's Graph API rather than SMTP)

This plugin addresses the limitations of current free SMTP plugins, allowing you to send email from WordPress via your Microsoft Account and ensure your email gets delivered reliably, avoiding the spam box! Note, unlike other free SMTP plugins, this one authenticates with the Microsoft Graph API rather than SMTP using OAuth2. This addresses the recent change by Microsoft to disable basic authentication over SMTP (i.e. username and password), preventing other free SMTP plugins from working with Microsoft Accounts. **Unfortunately, Microsoft has yet to enable their Graph API to work with the free versions of Outlook, Live, Hotmail etc. The plugin should however work with the paid for personal and business versions of Office 365, Outlook and Microsoft Exchange.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
What does it do?

Put simply, the plugin relays all emails sent from WordPress through your Microsoft email account (or an account of your choosing, for example a shared mailbox). This helps improve the deliverability of your WordPress mail, as Microsoft’s mail servers are set up to avoid being flagged as spam, and should already be configured as the trusted mail server for your domain.

Why another WordPress mail plugin?!

Microsoft has disabled basic authentication (username and password) over the SMTP protocol, requiring more modern and secure methods of authentication such as OAuth 2.0 (the protocol used by this plugin). As such most of the SMTP plugins available do not support Office 365/Outlook, or if they do, the functionality is a paid for feature.

What are the prerequisites?

To start using Mail Integration for Office 365, you need to setup a Microsoft Azure Active Directory account. Azure Active Directory comes in several flavours (paid and free), but it is possible to use the free tier for the purpose of this plugin. You can register for this here (you’re probably already registered if you are using Office 365). You will also need SSL enabled for at least the admin side of your website to ensure the OAuth keys are exchanged over a secure connection.
